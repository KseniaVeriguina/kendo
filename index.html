					<h2>About Kendo</h2>

						<blockquote>
						<p>
						To mold the mind and body,<br>
						To cultivate a vigorous spirit,<br>
						And through correct and rigid training<br>
						To strive for improvement in the art of Kendo,<br>
						To hold in esteem human courtesy and honor,<br>
						To associate with others with sincerity,<br>
						And to forever pursue the cultivation of oneself.
						</p>

						<p>Thus will one be able:</p>

						<p>To love one’s country and society,<br>
						To contribute to the development of culture,<br>
						And to promote peace and prosperity among all peoples.
						</p>
						<p class="ref">– The Concept of Kendo was published by the All Japan Kendo Federation in 1975.</p>
						</blockquote>

						<p>Kendo can be literally translated as “The Way of the Sword”. Aimed at improving the mind and body through the practice of swordsmanship, Kendo is a martial art with roots in the Japanese Samurai tradition, dating back well over a thousand years. A concise History of Kendo can be found on the <a href="">All Japan Kendo Federation</a> site.</p>

						<p>Modern Kendo consists of two basic types of practice. The first is Kata, consisting of choreographed series of attacks and counter-attacks practiced using wooden swords or replica live blades. The second is practice using the “shinai”, a bamboo sword designed to be safely used in conjunction with protective equipment, to permit full contact practice of cuts, thrusts and blocking techniques.</p>

						<p>Practitioners of Kendo try to achieve perfection in Japanese style sword fighting techniques while developing oneself emotionally and spiritually. In this regard, showing proper etiquette and respect to your opponent in equal measure to yourself are what distinguishes Kendo from other sports. Mental toughness is necessary and must be greater as one progresses in rank. The physical, emotional and spiritual learning required in training keeps Kendo practice modern.</p>

					<h2>Membership</h2>

					<h3>Can I Join?</h3>
					<p>We welcome anyone age 8 or above who is interested in learning Kendo and is willing to accept the direction of the club’s instructors in matters of etiquette and safety. Completion of a membership form containing a waiver clause is required.</p>

					<h3>When Can I Join?</h3>
					<p>Please contact the club if you are interested in joining!  Beginner classes normally commence in September, January and May, however joining mid-term can be done. We welcome fellow kendoka and those with previous experience to join us at any time.</p>

					<h3>Do I need anything Special to Start?</h3>
					<p>Nope! When you are just starting kendo, all you need is to wear some clothes you don’t mind working out in. A t-shirt and shorts/sweats are best. We focus on footwork at the start, and so it is helpful to wear something that does not hide your feet (i.e. long, baggy pants). If you have yoga pants, these work as long as you can roll them up so we can see your feet easily. No jeans please! Most senior students have an extra shinai to lend out for the first little while, so never fear! Come ready to practice and we’re happy to have you join us!</p>
					<p>The club coordinates with a local equipment supplier (<a href="http://www.kendoyu.com" target="_blank">KendoYu</a>) for beginner equipment deals, usually once a term. So come as you are!</p>

					<h3>Membership/Practice Fees</h3>
					<p>The Mississauga Kendo Club collects fees on a per term (4 month) basis, and are due in January, May and September. This is mainly based on the typcial 4-month University term – as we practice at UTM, it is a convenient process. Current term fees are:</p>
